    <h2 id="h2">Tale of a Little Plane</h2>
    <p id="fairy-tayle">There was a Little Plane. It was a white airplane with a blue stripe on its side and two red
      stars on the wings. He lived in a beautiful box that stood under the bed. Alyosha sometimes took him out for a
      walk. The boy went to the field near the house, opened the box, took out the airplane and let it fly. Airplane joy
      fully soared up straight from the hand of the boy. He did several laps and obediently lowered himself to the feet
      of his master.

    </p>
    <p id="fairy-tayle2">
      But one day Little Plane became interested in flying and did not notice how it flew away very far from its boy.
      And when Little Plane came to his senses, he did not know which way to return to him. Then he climbed into the
      foliage of the tree and waited for Alyosha. But Alyosha did not come. Rain poured water on Little Plane, the sun
      burned Little Plane wings. And Little Plane was still waiting for his master. When, finally, he realized that Alyosha
      had lost him and was unlikely to be able to find him, Little Plane decided to act on his own. He asked the moon if
      she knew which side he was in, the airplane, the house? Luna replied that she did not know. A little thought, she
      said she saw a place where a lot of planes lived, and can show him the way.

    </p>
    <p id="fairy-tayle3">
      Then Little Plane asked for help from Wind. The wind shook the tree, the airplane took off and headed in the
      direction the moon showed. Very soon, he really saw many airplanes down below. Some of them flew up, others
      sat down. It was evident that they were very carefully looked after: they painted their sides, washed, fed
      them with gasoline. Airplane decided to stay on the airfield to gain strength to find his boy. He was very
      welcome. Big planes greeted him with a roar. At the airfield Little Plane repaired, painted. He became as beautiful
      as he was when he lived under Alyosha’s bed. Airplane remained on the airfield. He also began to work. He was
      entrusted to deliver the mail. Other aircraft treated him with respect. He began to learn in the general noise
      of the aircraft. The airplane, of course, was happy about this, but in the evenings he dreamed of the time when
      he would meet his boy. And they met.

    </p>
    <p id="fairy-tayle4">
      One day, returning from a flight, Little Plane flew over a familiar field. At the edge of the field,
      he saw Alyosha. Airplane happily went to land to land at the feet of his boy. A familiar box stood
      at his feet: it means that the boy still hoped that the Airplane would return. Of course, Alyosha recognized
      his Airplane with a blue stripe on its side and stars on its wings. He was very pleased with the return of his
      Airplane. But it turned out that during this time the Airplane became more than its owner. Now he would not have
      been able to take off from Alyosha’s hand, even though Alyosha had grown up during that time. But this did not
      spoil the joy of meeting friends. Alyosha sat down in Little Plane, took up the helm. Together they returned to the
      airfield and never parted again.
